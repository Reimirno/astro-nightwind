# Astro Example with Nightwind

This is an example of how to use the [Nightwind](https://github.com/jjranalli/nightwind) in an Astro project for easy dark mode support when using Tailwind CSS.

Tailwind is integrated using the official [Astro Tailwind plugin](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/tailwind/).

This example also assumes you uses at least one UI Framework with Astro. This example uses [React](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/react/).
